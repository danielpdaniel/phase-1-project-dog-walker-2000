# Phase 1 Project Dog Walker 2000

DOG WALKER 2000 is a game where you "walk" a dog around the screen to collect bones. 

    The app uses json-server and a db.json file to fetch info on 5 dogs then uses that info to populate a series of cards for each dog, as well as a dropdown menu that allows you to select which dog you'd like to play as.

    Pressing the "+" or "-" buttons will change how far the dog moves with each key-press.

    The dog images were drawn by me, but are hosted on postimg.cc
