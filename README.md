# Phase 1 Project Dog Walker 2000

DOG WALKER 2000 is a game where you "walk" a dog around the screen to collect bones. 

    The game uses the Dog CEO API (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to generate 5 random dogs available in a dropdown menu. The user can select which dog they'd like to walk from this menu, then use the arrow keys to walk the selected dog all over the screen. 

    Pressing the "+" or "-" buttons will change how far the dog moves with each key-press.
