# Phase 1 Project Dog Walker 2000

DOG WALKER 2000 is a game where the user "walks" a dog around the screen to collect bones. 

## Game Instructions

Use the keyboard arrow keys to navigate your dog around the screen

The select menu allows the player to change which dog they play as.

all available dog options are visible via the dog cards on screen.

Pressing the "+" or "-" buttons will change how far the dog moves with each key-press.

## Sources and Contributions

The app uses [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) and a db.json file to fetch info on 5 dogs, then uses that info to populate a series of cards for each dog. json-server also allows the app to keep a running tally of how many games each dog has won.
